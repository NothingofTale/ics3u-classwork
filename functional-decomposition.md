# Functional Decomposition
## Vending Machine

Vending machine from the machines perspective:

- Wait for $ to be inserted
  - Display $ inserted 
- Wait for a code number
  - Read code number
  - Compare inserted amount to the price attatched to the code number
- If inserted amount >= price
  - subtract price from inserted amount
  - drop remainder into change bin
  - find and release food 
  - otherwise display invalid
- If the change button is pressed
  - release inserted amount

Conditional branching: whether or not the person has inserted the right amount\
Loop: Repeat the process continuously\
Nested structure: if statements in while loop\
